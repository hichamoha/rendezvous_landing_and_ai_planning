## Rendezvous Landing using ROS and PDDL-Based AI Planning of Robotic Inspection Missions: Deploying Ground and Aerial Robots in Automated Industrial Inspections

The aim of this project consists of two distinct problems to solve. These two following objectives will be accomplished using the WARA-PS Core System, which is a ROS-based software framework. 

### Rendezvous Landing Problem 
The objective of the first problem is to design and implement a suitable Rendezvous algorithm to perform an autonomous landing of the quadrotor UAV "DJI Matrix 100" on top of the quadruped Spot robot. 

### AI Planning Problem
In the second task, we will deal with the important topic of automating industrial inspections with agile mobile robots like Spot. Then, the objective would be to solve an AI planning problem, i.e., an Artificial Intelligence (AI) automated planning of robotic inspecting missions for Spot robot together with the UAV. As such, it will be possible to automatically search for a way of combining actions into a "strategic plan" $\pi = a_0, \dots, a_n$ that can achieve a desired goal in a certain area of inspection scenario.
